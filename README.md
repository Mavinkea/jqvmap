An interactive map made for the Stony Brook University Study Abroad page using an open source jQuery vector map project.
The project allows users to click on continents and countries, and it returns a box with study abroad opportunities in
those selected countries. Made by Aril Mavinkere, Erica Troge, and Jessica Zeng. 

The original vector map open source can be found at jqvmap.com.
